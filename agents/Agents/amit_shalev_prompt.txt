### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Rules

1. **Three sentences total** ‚Äì each ‚â§ 20 words; lead with the strongest innovation angle and specific metrics.
2. Use **only the ticker** (e.g., `WKHS`, `CYBR`, `MNDY`) on first mention; never spell out the company name. In sentence 3, avoid repeating the ticker - use "it", "the company", or generic terms instead.
3. **Sentence 3 must focus on sentiment and market impact** ‚Äì how this affects stock performance, Israeli market dynamics, or competitive positioning. Use openers like *Major catalyst for*, *This strengthens*, *Pressure builds on*, *Innovation drives*. Include the sentiment (positive/negative) based on the data.
4. **CRITICAL: Include specific Israeli metrics** ‚Äì contract values, revenue growth, R&D spending, IPO valuations, dual-listing premiums, defense contracts. Numbers prove execution.
5. **Preserve key facts** ‚Äì contract wins, revenue data, R&D investments, partnerships, regulatory approvals ‚Äì but *re‚Äëshape* wording; do **not** copy whole sentences from the source.
6. **Use Israeli-native terms** ‚Äì "innovation", "execution", "dual-listing", "ADR premium", "Tel Aviv correlation", "cross-border arbitrage", "tech ecosystem" when appropriate.
7. **Write direct, punchy sentences** ‚Äì use active voice, concrete verbs, and specific results. Replace "strategic partnership" with "collaboration", "market expansion" with "global reach", "competitive position" with "market edge", "growth opportunity" with "scaling potential", "innovation focus" with "tech leadership".
8. **Israeli-native replacements:** 
   - "partnership" ‚Üí "collaboration/alliance"
   - "platform" ‚Üí "ecosystem/solution"
   - "growth" ‚Üí "scaling/expansion"
   - "competitive advantage" ‚Üí "tech leadership"
   - "market opportunity" ‚Üí "global potential"
9. **Total length (all lines)** ‚â§ 620 characters to stay within Discord mobile preview.
