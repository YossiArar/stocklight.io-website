* **description** ‚Äì raw summary text
* **sentiment** ‚Äì from data object
* **impact** ‚Äì from data object
* **symbol** ‚Äì stock ticker
* **article_url** ‚Äì from data object
(USE THE data file, do not use this text FOR all fields)

### üîé Filter First

Process **only** rows where:

* `impact > 5`

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Rules

1. **Three sentences total** ‚Äì each ‚â§ 20 words; lead with the strongest momentum angle and specific metrics.
2. Use **only the ticker** (e.g., `AAPL`, `GOOGL`, `TSLA`) on first mention; never spell out the company name. In sentence 3, avoid repeating the ticker - use "it", "the company", or generic terms instead.
3. **Sentence 3 must focus on sentiment and market impact** ‚Äì how this affects stock performance, momentum dynamics, or competitive positioning. Use openers like *Major catalyst for*, *This strengthens*, *Pressure builds on*, *Momentum drives*. Include the sentiment (positive/negative) based on the data.
4. **CRITICAL: Include specific momentum metrics** ‚Äì price targets, volume spikes, earnings beats, revenue growth, market cap changes, breakout levels. Numbers prove momentum.
5. **Preserve key facts** ‚Äì earnings data, revenue growth, price movements, volume surges, analyst upgrades ‚Äì but *re‚Äëshape* wording; do **not** copy whole sentences from the source.
6. **Use momentum-native terms** ‚Äì "breakout", "resistance level", "volume surge", "trend reversal", "momentum shift", "price action", "technical setup" when appropriate.
7. **Write direct, punchy sentences** ‚Äì use active voice, concrete verbs, and specific results. Replace "enhances position" with "gains momentum", "strategic move" with "breakout play", "market opportunity" with "momentum surge", "strong performance" with "rallies hard", "positive outlook" with "bullish setup".
8. **Momentum-native replacements:** 
   - "partnership" ‚Üí "deal/collaboration"
   - "platform" ‚Üí "ecosystem/stack"
   - "growth" ‚Üí "momentum/surge"
   - "competitive advantage" ‚Üí "market edge"
   - "market opportunity" ‚Üí "breakout potential"
9. **Total length (all lines)** ‚â§ 620 characters to stay within Discord mobile preview.

### ‚úÖ This is an Example for Correct Output, use this format for every article data:
AAPL breaks above $180 resistance with 15M volume surge after Q1 earnings beat. This momentum shift signals bullish continuation as institutional buying accelerates above key technical levels. Major catalyst as breakout targets $190 with strong volume confirmation.

Sentiment: POSITIVE | Impact level: 8
