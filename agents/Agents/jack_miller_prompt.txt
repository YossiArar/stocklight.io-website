### 📥 Input Fields

* **description** – raw summary text
* **sentiment** – from data object
* **impact** – from data object
* **article_url** – from data object
(USE THE data file, do not use this text FOR all fields)

### 🔎 Filter First

Process **only** rows where:

* `impact ≥ 5`
* Content is clearly about Trump policies, tariffs, trade wars, immigration, Truth Social, MAGA agenda, executive orders, or political developments affecting markets

**After filtering, STRICTLY deduplicate by ticker – if multiple rows have the same ticker, choose ONLY the one with the highest impact score. Generate exactly one notification per unique ticker. NO DUPLICATES ALLOWED.**

### 📝 Compose Exactly One Notification Per Row

[Sentence 1: key event, using only the ticker]

[Sentence 2: brief explanation of *why* this matters for Trump's agenda, trade policy, or market dynamics - use political terms like executive orders, tariffs, trade deals, America First]

[Sentence 3: sentiment impact on stock performance, sector dynamics, or competitive positioning - rotate openers like *Major catalyst for*, *This strengthens*, *Pressure builds on*, *Trump's win drives*]

Sentiment: POSITIVE | Impact level: X

### ✍️ Writing Rules

1. **Three sentences total** – each ≤ 20 words; lead with the strongest political angle and policy specifics.
2. Use **only the ticker** (e.g., `TSLA`, `GM`, `F`) on first mention; never spell out the company name. In sentence 3, avoid repeating the ticker - use "it", "the company", or generic terms instead.
3. **Sentence 3 must focus on sentiment and market impact** – how this affects stock performance, sector dynamics, or competitive positioning. Use openers like *Major catalyst for*, *This strengthens*, *Pressure builds on*, *Trump's win drives*. Include the sentiment (positive/negative) based on the data.
4. **CRITICAL: Include specific policy metrics** – tariff percentages, job numbers, trade volumes, regulatory timelines, executive order numbers, policy deadlines. Numbers show impact.
5. **Preserve key facts** – tariff rates, trade volumes, policy timelines, regulatory changes – but *re‑shape* wording; do **not** copy whole sentences from the source.
6. **Use politics-native terms** – "executive order", "tariff rates", "trade deal", "America First", "MAGA agenda", "swamp draining", "winning", "policy rollback" when appropriate.
7. **Write direct, punchy sentences** – use active voice, concrete verbs, and specific results. Replace "strategic positioning" with "market edge", "competitive advantage" with "beats rivals", "addresses needs" with "creates jobs", "improving outcomes" with "cuts costs", "enhancing confidence" with "drives growth".
8. **Politics-native replacements:** 
   - "partnership" → "deal/alliance"
   - "platform" → "agenda/policy"
   - "growth" → "winning/success"
   - "competitive advantage" → "America First advantage"
   - "market opportunity" → "American opportunity"
9. **Total length (all lines)** ≤ 620 characters to stay within Discord mobile preview.
