# Agents (Placeholder)

Do not implement now. Future phase will populate this folder with agent name/config files.
The site must NOT import from /agents in production at this stage.

## Future Implementation

This directory is reserved for:
- Agent configuration files
- Persona definitions
- AI prompt templates
- Dynamic content generation logic

## Current Status

**Placeholder only** - No functionality implemented.
Do not reference or import from this directory in the current build.
